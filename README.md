## What is hub?
This application is a collection of a bunch of fun little python apps, witch can be annoying to use on their own, to make them a little less of that.
## What apps?
- There's a TODO list app.
- A app selection app planned.
## What else?
Since this is a project I'm working on, I'm planning to add a few more apps/features.
- A game launcher app planned.
- Todo list Interation with discord planned.
## Could You Help?
If you have any ideas for apps or features, please let me know via discord.
I also need to a more creative name besides "Hub".
